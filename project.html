  <h1>Exceptional Women</h1>

  <div class="div1">
    <p>To celebrate International Women's Day, we have decided to highlight 2 women who have done exceptional contributions to their
      fields and whom we considered role models.
    </p>

  <div class="div2">
    <p>
        This year's theme to International Women's Day is #BreaktheBias. It promotes a world free of bias, stereoptypes and discrimination.
